# Complete Linear Regression Case Stusy

In this activity, you will work with your co-participants to solve an ML problem through linear regression. In the beginning, you need to use the learned skills and techniques to clean the data and select the right features for the model. You will also need to encode categorical and ordinal features. Then, you will fit the linear regression model to the cleaned dataset and evaluate the fitted model.

## Steps to solve the case study: 

 * Create a google colab notebook for this activity;
 * Read the description of the dataset in Kaggle;
 * Download the dataset from Kaggle and then load it into the google colab notebook. You may use other methods to make the dataset available for reading in the notebook such as storing the dataset in google drive and mounting the drive into the colab notebook;
 * Use EDA techniques to clean the dataset, encode any categorical data, and use feature selection and engineering to select the best features to solve the case study;
 * Split the dataset into training and testing datasets;
 * Use the sklearn to fit and evaluate the linear regression model;
 * Comment on the evaluation of the logistic regression;
 * Add explanatory comments to the google colab notebook in the text cells;
 * Save the google colab notebook in the GitHub repository.
