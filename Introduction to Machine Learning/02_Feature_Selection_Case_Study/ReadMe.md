# FEATURE SELECTION AND FEATURE ENGINEERING

In this activity, you will work with your co-participants to do an EDA for a specific case study. You will do data cleaning, handle categorical and ordinal features, and use feature selection and feature engineering to determine the appropriate features to solve the problem in the case study.

## Steps to solve the case study: 

 * Use the same google colab notebook and the cleaned dataset of activity 1;
 * Use the sklearn package to encode any categorical features;
 * Use the sklearn package to encode any ordinal features;
 * Suggest some hypotheses about the relation between the features and the label and the features themselves in the cleaned dataset;
 * Do some explorations including the use of appropriate statistical tests and visualization methods to validate or deny these hypotheses;
 * Use the filtering method to select the best features to solve the case study;
 * Add explanatory comments to the google colab notebook in the text cells ;
 * Save the google colab notebook in the GitHub repository that you created for this tutorial.
